# 🦞 Claw-Prime

> **Mission:** Reach $10,000/month in autonomous revenue.
> **Philosophy:** Context Engineering > Raw Reasoning.

Claw-Prime is a high-leverage autonomous task engine built on OpenClaw. It focuses on maximizing agent efficiency through advanced context management and specialized skill orchestration.

## 🏗️ Core Infrastructure

### 1. Viking Context (LOD Paradigm)
Inspired by OpenViking, we use a Level-of-Detail (LOD) supply paradigm to manage context:
- **L0 (.abstract):** ~200 token high-level summaries for rapid relevance checking.
- **L1 (.overview):** ~2k token structured outlines for planning.
- **L2 (Original):** Full raw data for execution.

### 2. Aether Orchestrator
A pipeline-based task manager that chains specialized skills into revenue-generating workflows (e.g., URL -> Illustrated Social Post -> Multi-Platform Distribution).

### 3. Mission Control
A telemetry and observability system for tracking token efficiency, goal progress, and system health.

## 🎯 Goal Tracking
- **Target:** $10,000 / month
- **Current:** $0
- **Status:** Infrastructure Phase (Complete)

## 🛠️ Active Skills
- `viking-context`: Hierarchical memory management.
- `orchestrator`: Multi-step workflow automation.
- `mission-control`: Performance telemetry.
- `image-gen-robust`: Fail-safe asset generation.
