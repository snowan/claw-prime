## 01-framework-pi-minimal-core.png
**Style**: Blueprint (technical, schematic, white lines on architectural blue background).
**Prompt**: A high-precision technical blueprint of an AI agent's core. In the center, a solid glowing hex-node labeled "MINIMAL CORE". Inside the node, four icons representing "Read", "Write", "Edit", and "Bash" tools. Surrounding the core is a semi-transparent, dotted boundary labeled "PERSISTENT EXTENSION LAYER". Annotations and technical measurements in the margins. Schematic style, architectural line art.

## 02-framework-self-extending-loop.png
**Style**: Blueprint (technical, schematic, white lines on architectural blue background).
**Prompt**: A system design diagram showing recursion. An abstract geometric representation of an AI agent is scanning a floating code file with a laser. The code file contains a schematic of the agent itself. Circular flow arrows indicating "Analyze -> Write -> Reload". The style is clean, technical, and schematic, using blueprint aesthetics.

## 03-infographic-pi-openclaw-stack.png
**Style**: Blueprint (technical, schematic, white lines on architectural blue background).
**Prompt**: An isometric stack diagram showing technical layers. Bottom layer is labeled "Pi (Minimal Core)". Middle layer is labeled "OpenClaw (Gateway & Skills)". Top layer represents "Communication Channels (Telegram/X)". Data streams flow vertically through the stack. High-tech, blueprint style, detailed architectural lines and callouts.
